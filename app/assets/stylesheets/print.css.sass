 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets/print, vendor/assets/stylesheets/print,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets/print of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add print-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
